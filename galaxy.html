                         The Segmentae Majoris are:
                     </p>
                    <p>
                         Segmentum Solar - Located in the Imperium's centre with Terra at its very heart, the Segmentum Solar's Segmentum Fortress lies at the nexus point of the massive orbital fleet yards of Mars. The Segmentum Solar is home to the very heart of Imperial territory, ancient and very wealthy worlds that have been settled by humanity since before even the invention of Warp-Drive. Many of the Imperium's most strategically important planets, including the battleground Hive World of Armageddon, lie within this Segmentum.
                         Segmentum Obscurus - Located to the galactic north of Terra, the Segmentum Obscurus is where the Eye of Terror and the Imperial Fortress World of Cadia are located, making the Sectors of this Segmentum among the most heavily militarised in the Imperium to protect them from the near constant incursions of the Forces of Chaos. The Segmentum Obscurus' primary Segmentum Naval Base is located at the world of Cypra Mundi.
                         Ultima Segmentum - Positioned to the galactic east of Terra and the Segmentum Solar, the Ultima Segmentum is by far the largest of the Segmentae and also the least densely populated by human-settled worlds, having long served as the Imperial frontier. The Ultima Segmentum is home to the Ultramarines Chapter's Realm of Ultramar and is adjacent to the true frontier of the galaxy, which is known as the Eastern Fringes. It was from the Ultima Segmentum that the first Tyranid Hive Fleets attacked the worlds of the Imperium. The Eastern Fringes, not officially considered a part of the Ultima Segmentum, are also home to the upstart Tau Empire that has in recent centuries proved to be a durable xenos threat to Imperial control of the region. The primary Segmentum Fortress and Segmentum Naval Base is located on the world of Kar Duniash.
                         Segmentum Tempestus - Comprising the territory to the galactic south of the Segmentum Solar, the Segmentum Tempestus, despite its name, is one of the least troubled regions of the Imperium. It is dominated by the political might of the Ecclesiarchy and is home to the second most holy Cardinal World of the Imperial Cult after Terra itself -- Ophelia VII. Segmentum Tempestus' Segmentum Naval Base is located in orbit of the world of Bakka.
                         Segmentum Pacificus - This Segmentum contains all of the territory located to the galactic west of the Segmentum Solar. Like the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy bordering the Ultima Segmentum, Segmentum Pacificus is largely frontier territory, lightly settled by humanity in comparison to the other Segmentae. The Segmentum Pacificus' Segmentum Naval Base is located in orbit of the world of Hydraphur.
